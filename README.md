REST API for E-Learning Platform
</h1>

<p align="justify">
Built on Laravel, E-Learning Platform API empowers your E-Learning platform with essential modules such as Account Details, Authentication, Courses, Lessons Operations, Modules Management, Password Recovery, and Support and Reply.

**Authentication:** E-Learning Platform uses Sanctum for secure authentication. For testing in Postman, refer to the [API Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sanctum#main-content) on how to authenticate using Sanctum.

**Caching:** E-Learning Platform utilizes Redis for caching to enhance performance and scalability.
